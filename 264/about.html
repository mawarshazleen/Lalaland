    <div>Fashion is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending. Everything that is considered fashion is available and popularized by the fashion system (industry and media).

        Due to increased mass-production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach, sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers. The fashion industry consists of four levels:
    <ol>
        <li>The production of raw materials, principally Fiber, and textiles but also leather and fur.</li>
        <li>The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.</li>
        <li>Retail sales</li>
        <li>Various forms of advertising and promotion.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
</table>
